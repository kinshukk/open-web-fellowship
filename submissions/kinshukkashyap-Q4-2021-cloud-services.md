  ## Overview
  Work on the textile grant for multi-tiered storage on filecoin and IPFS. Create a dashboard for reseachers to add data to IPFS storage, with the option to also store redundantly on Filecoin -> this would include seeing level of redundancy, number of miners storing data, time left in storage deal, etc.
  Along with this, perform benchmark tests for the storage pipeline.
  
  Metadata parsing for datalad in the backend, + work on prototype hosted DataLad service (use datalad through an API)
  
  Build a suite of DeSci tools optimized for easy integration with the larger web3 ecosystem.
  
  ## Implementation Plan
